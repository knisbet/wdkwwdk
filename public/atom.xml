		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin can be a polarizing topic. There are certainly a strong following of bitcoin and derivatives, but many of the engineers I know are opposed to the technology. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What motivated me to finally get this post out however, is the other week I encountered a non-engineer, non-technical advocate for Bitcoin. They were a restaurant worker, and explained they have a side gig of helping others gt into bitcoin. And we had a bit of a discussion on why I don&#x27;t believe in Bitcoin, or derivatives, as a form of asset, payment, etc.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And it comes down to, sitting at a restaurant, look around the room, who in that room can effectively and safely use Bitcoin. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;who-can-safely-use-bitcoin&quot;&gt;Who can safely use Bitcoin?&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Almost no one.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the tech industry, working with very technical folks, it&#x27;s easy to forget most people are not tech workers. Computers are a tool too many, but they don&#x27;t understand how they work. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had a conversation with my Sister once, where I tried to explain just what a block chain is. And she didn&#x27;t get it. Not that knowing how it works is necessary. The problem with bitcoin is, someone needs to handle some secrets pretty securely to not lose all of their money. Look around the room, and identify who can really employ the personal security required to effectively use cold wallets, verify destination addresses, not to store their secret incorrectly, backup the secrets incase of a hard drive failure, etc. All techniques required to ensure their money doesn&#x27;t disappear.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I think Bitcoin has a unstated premise, that users need a high degree of expertise in best practices to even use the technology.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Most people don&#x27;t have the time for this, or the technical basis to even learn it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-bitcoin-doesn-t-do&quot;&gt;What bitcoin doesn&#x27;t do?&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Living in a stable western democracy, I think there is a bit of a flaw in the concept of Bitcoin. In our techno sphere where we&#x27;re used to controlling computers through our code, we forget that our current money system has lots of checks and balances in place, and banking over decades has built many rules to accommodate exceptions, many of which we as individuals have never had to deal with in our lives.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I like to think of problems in the sense of properties:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;mistakes&quot;&gt;Mistakes&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mistakes will happen. Many by user input failures, ignoring checks and balances, software bugs, rushing, or even hardware failures that corrupt memory. The current banking system doesn&#x27;t always get this right, and it may not be instant, but in many cases banking failures can be corrected. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Bitcoin, as a cryptographic ledger, immortalizing all mistakes. The only reversible change in the theory of blockchains, is to have the destination run a second transaction to return an amount. Sure, developers have gotten together to tamper with some of the chains to reverse problems before, but no one is fixing the $1000 sent to an address that doesn&#x27;t exist.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;power-of-attorney-estate&quot;&gt;Power of attorney &#x2F; Estate&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s easy to forget, that in some circumstances at some point in our lives our assets may need to be turned over to others. Whether it&#x27;s a death, and turning over the estate, or some other condition that leads to or requires power of attorney. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m sure the Bitcoin advocates can point to failures of this system, or unjust conservatorship that&#x27;s been applied. But on average, this is a system that applies to millions of people, that doesn&#x27;t really have a Bitcoin equivalent. Recovery from sudden death, means a pre-planned method of preserving and turning over secrets, that not many will do. And then the additional operational security of only having the secrets turned over when required, and that the storage of those secrets doesn&#x27;t become the weak link to steal all of someones &amp;quot;money&amp;quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And something as simple as rotating your secrets, now requires many additional steps.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;court-orders&quot;&gt;Court orders&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you went to court, got a judgement. Maybe it&#x27;s big, maybe it&#x27;s small. And the opponent doesn&#x27;t pay what is ordered by the court. Bitcoin removes an option here for enforcement, if the money is sitting in a bank. If the judgement is large and the party simply decides not to pay, are you going to garnish wages for the next 20 years? When the money you&#x27;re owed is just sitting their.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hell, in these types of conflicts someone could in a fit of deviancy decide to just destroy the amount by transferring to nowhere instead of complying with the judgement, and then good luck.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m just waiting for the first court cases to explore Blockchains, and orders for transfers. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;legal-enforcement&quot;&gt;Legal Enforcement&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realize for many this might be a feature, but I think of it as a bug. For the most part I agree with law enforcement holds, as long as their is a strong judiciary process, and government sanctions. Can someone find a sanction I disagree with, of course. But I also live in a represented society where I&#x27;m not going to agree with every law enforcement or government decision, and that&#x27;s fine.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And there are real problems with some of these systems, asset forfeiture is rampant, but do I really believe that using a digital wallet is going to stop a government from stealing my stuff. We need to demand better of our institutions where they fail, not work around them and opening the flood gates for criminal behaviour. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;for-those-who-don-t-have-strong-institutions&quot;&gt;For those who don&#x27;t have strong institutions&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I know Bitcoin is having some success where the commerce of the state is failing, for various reasons. I don&#x27;t have a good answer for that use case. But I don&#x27;t believe in the long run, that Bitcoin successfully replaces the institutions of banking, legal recourse, and security for those who don&#x27;t have those institutions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So there are very real problems to be solved here, and I understand why Bitcoin does get involved, but I think we should demand more here, not try to duct tape a severely flawed solution that forgets what purposes institutions serve in our lives. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h1 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;&#x2F;h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&#x27;m sure there are some who will sit around and say all of these are features. The times the court fail, government mistakes, illegitimate power of attorney occur could all be avoided with Bitcoin. No one should be able to force you to pay a penny you don&#x27;t want to.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But in my opinion, Bitcoin simply isn&#x27;t a technology the vast majority of the populace can use safely, or to achieve goals they can easily do with the current banking system.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I suspect too many dev teams have gone a bit too far the mantra of code should be self documenting. When interviewing developers, this is something I often pick up as a negative signal, is poor commenting style.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is just a reminder, that the code tells you what and how, and should be as clearly written as possible for other developers to follow using just the code. But this mantra doesn&#x27;t mean there should be no comments... comments are still important to indicate to the reader why a piece of code exists.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If a piece of code exists to implement a customer requirement, link to that requirement, external source of information, or simply explain the problem being solved. Otherwise, those who come after you, including yourself, will be doomed to repeat a bug, lose a requirement, or be stuck when changing code later.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;blog.codinghorror.com&#x2F;code-tells-you-how-comments-tell-you-why&#x2F;&quot;&gt;Code Tells You How, Comments Tell You Why - Coding Horror&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; for a better explanation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

		<content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it&#x27;s important to remind ourselves that we don&#x27;t know what we don&#x27;t know!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently began to spend more effort considering and emphasizing what pieces might be missing from a particular engineering puzzle. Like many engineers, I rely heavily on mental models when tackling technical problems. The problem is, these mental models are seldom complete, with gaps or assumptions, which leads to mistakes or discounting approaches to a question we didn&#x27;t know to consider.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&#x27;s spend some time considering what it means not to know what we don&#x27;t know and how we can remind ourselves of some of our own biases.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-first-experience-with-wdkwwdk&quot;&gt;My first experience with WDKWWDK&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, this realization first came during a meeting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were trying to tackle a specific security challenge that required selecting a cryptographic protocol with particular properties. I was in the position to make the recommendations, which came down to &lt;a href=&quot;http:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.noiseprotocol.org&quot;&gt;Noise&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; based on some &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;latacora.com&quot;&gt;industry experts&#x27;&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; suggestions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem we had is we weren&#x27;t able to locate an implementation of the protocol for our embedded CPU. While I was evolving into a security lead for the team with a better than average understanding of security principles, I was utterly ill-prepared to write a crypto implementation that would pass any scrutiny.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, with the most knowledge, the team asked me to develop the implementation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I objected, indicating that writing a cryptographic implementation is detailed work, and it&#x27;s challenging to be sure that the implementation is correct.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team countered, saying that it must be correct if the implementation can communicate with another library (on a known CPU architecture).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The problem is it&#x27;s possible to write a compatible protocol implementation, that has significant security problems. Re-using nonces or timing attacks could ruin our day, and we&#x27;d easily miss out on the security properties we desired.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team countered again, indicating that if I knew about problems like nonce re-use or timing attacks, that I should avoid those problems. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Any problem I can describe in theory should be a problem I can avoid.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Eventually, I had to figure out to approach this engineering conversation as an admission, I don&#x27;t know what I don&#x27;t know, so I&#x27;m ill-prepared to solve problems I don&#x27;t even know to avoid. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only did I need to admit what I didn&#x27;t know, but as a team, we had to admit combined that we didn&#x27;t know what we didn&#x27;t know. In many scenarios, we may be able to get away with this, but here, a failure meant we failed to deliver on our security promises to our customers.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;is-this-the-dunning-kruger-effect&quot;&gt;Is this the Dunning-Kruger effect?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For those who aren&#x27;t familiar, a simplified version of the Dunning-Kruger effect states that a cognitive bias exists where individuals with limited knowledge or competence in a given intellectual domain greatly overestimate their expertise or skill in that domain. And that those with a great deal of expertise tend to underestimate their results. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This cognitive bias is fascinating and may explain some of the &amp;quot;solutions&amp;quot; or &amp;quot;projects&amp;quot; we see that claim perfect security while not holding up to basic scrutiny.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While the Dunning-Kruger effect may apply here, we often forget that this cognitive bias only means that people scoring in the 12th percentile had ranked themselves in the 62nd percentile. But those in the 90th percentile had self-assessed to be within the ~75th percentile. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;profile&#x2F;David_Dunning2&#x2F;publication&#x2F;12688660&#x2F;figure&#x2F;fig1&#x2F;AS:394431292297232@1471051156893&#x2F;Perceived-ability-to-recognize-humor-as-a-function-of-actual-test-performance-Study-1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Image from Dunning-Kruger Research&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.researchgate.net&#x2F;figure&#x2F;Perceived-ability-to-recognize-humor-as-a-function-of-actual-test-performance-Study-1_fig1_12688660&quot;&gt;Dunning-Kruger effect on research gate for more information&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;
&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;&lt;br &#x2F;&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, on average, individuals without much exposure do not rank themselves as experts in an area they don&#x27;t know.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can still draw an important lesson here; that we need to be aware of and careful of our biases, whether it be the Dunning-Kruger effect or something else.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;unconscious-fear&quot;&gt;Unconscious Fear&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;imgs.xkcd.com&#x2F;comics&#x2F;ten_thousand.png&quot; alt=&quot;xkcd 1053&quot; &#x2F;&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;xkcd.com&#x2F;1053&#x2F;&quot;&gt;xkcd 1053&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As engineers, I think we get used to analyzing complex problems and coming back with answers. Especially those of us who are known for digging in and finding the solutions.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When given a task, there may also be a particular fear associated with not having the answer. If your leadership or team members expect you are an expert in a domain and are assigned a problem, it feels like a failure to return without the full solution. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For me, it&#x27;s even come to the point where others have tried shame me in front of my peers for not knowing some technical detail off hand. This behaviour creates perverse incentives that it&#x27;s better to stick with an assumption than admit we don&#x27;t know something. I know I&#x27;ve unconciously affected others in this same way, which is one of my regrets. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A large part of this is realizing it&#x27;s not a failure to admit that we have missing knowledge. We may not remember some details or have more research to do. Maybe there is no action required. The failure is to proceed without identifying the risk of the missing information. Whether an expert or not, there are always going to be missing details. When working in security, the missed detail could be the difference between high and abysmal security. In other domains, the risks may be much different.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing the risks of missing information allows us to choose whether to accept those risks. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;how-do-i-apply-this&quot;&gt;How do I apply this?&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think it&#x27;s as simple as stating, &amp;quot;We don&#x27;t know what we don&#x27;t know&amp;quot; in a conversation, or typing WDKWWDK into a document or chat session. And ensuring our teams and leaders don&#x27;t allow a stigma to exist around not knowing some details.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&#x27;m not the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;shaker.com&#x2F;questions-your-company-needs-to-be-asking-itself-and-acting-on-now&#x2F;&quot;&gt;first&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; to use this acronym, but I also don&#x27;t believe we use it enough.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This statement of fact, acts as a reminder, that we should step back and consider how our biases may impact a particular decision or design and to identify what information may be missing.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can then consider:&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What we know&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What we know we don&#x27;t know&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If there is anything we don&#x27;t know what we don&#x27;t know that needs exploration&lt;&#x2F;li&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And decide on the risks of proceeding with missing information, cognizant that there will always be missing information.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;summary&quot;&gt;Summary&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before committing to an approach to an engineering problem, remind yourself or the team that there are likely missing details that may affect the outcome. How to proceed largely depends on the risks involved, topics like security have different risks than the CI&#x2F;CD pipeline. &lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And we need to remind ourselves and our peers to avoid the stigmas and biases introduced by admitting we don&#x27;t know things. Being an expert in a domain like security, doesn&#x27;t mean memorization of every algorithm, every protocol, or approach.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
